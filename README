The basic idea is, that users can subscribe an iCalendar file 
with scheduled Icinga downtimes.

This script reads the status.dat that is written by Icinga and
extracts the scheduled downtimes for services and hosts. It writes
down a .ics file in the iCalendar format. This file can put on a 
HTTP server and subscribed with webcal://<server>/downtimes.ics
